  <p>       The department of Orthopaedic Surgery offers a number of pilot grants,
  intended for the research hand clinical faculty, in the $5,000 to $15,000 range.
  The grants are administered over a 1-year period and are aimed at generating
  pilot data for subsequent funding from other sources.  Request for proposals
  are communicated with email in early September of each year, and all submissions
  are subjected to external reviews to determine funding. Please contact Katiri Wagner for more information.</p>

  <p>       The OSCAR Program works with Orthopedic PIs to match their project and budget to the best funding
    mechanism and to prepare highly competitive grant submissions.
