        <p>
         <a href="https://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/elementsofgrantwriting/"><u>Harvard Catalyst Elements of Grant Writing</u></a> is a compilation of tips, timelines, and templates from a variety of grant-writing
         experts and funders designed to aid investigators in successfully applying for grants from federal, foundation, and corporate sources.
         It includes a repository of samples of successful and unsuccessful applications.  The guide is also a key component of the Grant Review and Support Program (GRASP).

        <p>
          <a href="https://catalyst.harvard.edu/courses/grasp/"><u>Harvard Catalyst Grant Review and Support Program (GRASP)</u></a> is a multi-year program that guides junior
           investigators who have already obtained a career development (K) award to understand the rules of engagement and the grant writing process, gain new skills, and to
           ultimately write competitive grant applications to achieve research independence.  GRASP begins with an orientation workshop to review program tools and
           longitudinal support, discuss tips on how to effectively communicate research, and provide an overview of the NIH grant review process. Participants will also
           attend sessions on how to diversify their funding portfolios and an in-depth training on R01-specific grant-writing techniques. Throughout the duration of their
           career development award, participants will receive ongoing grant preparation support and guidance from the GRASP team.
